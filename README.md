# `secure-file-transfer`

`secure-file-transfer` is the easiest solution for safely getting a file from one web browser to another. It works by connecting two people via WebTorrent and transferring files peer-to-peer via WebRTC. Files are encrypted prior to transmission and decrypted upon receipt, so data is never exposed to anyone other than the intended recipient. Files are never sent to a server.
